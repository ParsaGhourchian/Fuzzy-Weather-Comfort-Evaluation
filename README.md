# Fuzzy Weather Comfort Evaluation

This project demonstrates a simple fuzzy logic system using scikit-fuzzy to evaluate human comfort levels based on temperature and humidity.
It loads a real-world weather dataset, applies fuzzy membership functions, evaluates comfort using defined rules, and outputs a computed comfort score for each data point.

# 📌 Features
